# ISA Dental Frontend

This project is a **React + TypeScript + Vite** front-end for the **ISA Dental** appointment scheduling system. It provides a user-friendly interface for patients (and their dependents) to manage appointments, update insurance info, and communicate with the ISA Dental backend.

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)  
- **npm** (or **yarn**)  
- **Vite** build tool (automatically used when you run the scripts)  

_(Also recommended to run the [ISA Dental Backend](https://github.com/your-organization/dentist-appointment-backend) API for real data. If you don’t have the API running, you can use the mock data approach that’s included.)_

## Running Locally

1. **Start the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   By default, this will launch on **http://localhost:5173** (or the next available port).

2. **Open the browser** to see the site.  
   - You can log in with test credentials (if using mock data or your backend’s seeded data).

3. **Sign in / Sign up** as a user or use existing test credentials. Once authenticated, you can:  
   - View and book appointments.  
   - Manage your dependents.  
   - Update insurance information.  
   - (If admin) Access Admin Dashboard to manage Appointment Types, view all appointments, etc.

---

## Environment Variables

By default, the client looks for an environment variable in `.env`:

- **`API_BASE_URL`**: The base URL for the ISA Dental backend API.  
  Example:  
  ```
  API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/v1
  ```

Make sure this matches the address of your running backend API (Rails, Docker, etc.). If not set, it defaults to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1`.

---

## Deployment

Typical steps to deploy a Vite-based React app:

1. **Set `API_BASE_URL`** in your hosting environment or CI/CD build system.  
2. **Build** the production bundle:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   ```

   This will create a `dist` directory with static files.

3. **Deploy** those static files to a hosting provider (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, etc.).

---

## Future Enhancements / Next Steps

- **Additional Form Validations**: Enhance error messages and validation logic for appointments or profile data.  
- **User Notifications**: Integrate real-time notifications (e.g., WebSockets or push notifications) for appointment changes.  
- **Accessibility**: Ensure best practices for screen readers and keyboard navigation.  
- **i18n**: Internationalization support for multiple languages.  
- **Theming**: Support multiple color schemes or branding.
